# Start with boilerplate

For every website you will always need to write up the same code before you can code what you want, this is called writing boilerplate code. Copy the below into the textbox on the left.

#code-start#
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>

# Adding paragraphs

Like the last tutorial we are going to add text on screen using the <p> tag ('p' is short for paragraph).

#code-start#
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        *<p>This is some text</p>*
    </body>
</html>
#code-end#

# Adding headings

You might want to add a heading to your paragraph to make it more user-friendly for the website viewer. To do this we use the <h1> tag. 'h' stands for heading and 1 is the heading level. There are 6 variations of this tag that display text with various sizes. <h1> has the largest font size. <h6> has the smallest font size. 

#code-start#
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        *<h1>This is a heading</h1>*
        <p>This is some text</p>
    </body>
</html>
#code-end#

Try using the other headings.
