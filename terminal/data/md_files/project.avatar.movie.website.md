# Avatar 2

There's a new Avatar movie out and some may be skeptical to watch it after a decade of silence from the Avatar producers. Your job is to create a webpage that displays all relevant information to the new movie to help potential viewers decide whether to watch it or not.

Here's a checklist of all the things your website should include:
- A title on the tab bar of the Avatar 2 movie
- A small icon on the tab bar of the Avatar 2 movie
- A heading on the website saying: Should you watch Avatar 2
- An image of the movie poster
- A paragraph of the plot (can be found on the internet)
- A bullet point list of the main cast (use a heading to introduce the list)
- A numbered list of the top 20 highest grossing movies of all time (Avatar 2 should be on this somewhere - hopefully)

# Start with boilerplate

For every website you will always need to write up the same code before you can code what you want, this is called writing boilerplate code. Copy the below into the textbox on the left.

#code-start#
<html>
    <head>

# Review

Did your website include all the requirements? Was it informative? Did it include up-to-date information? Do the images work? Are there any typos?

These are the same questions professional website makers ask themselves after completing a job because there's nothing worse than an angry client who wants their money back because you didn't do what they paid you to do. To get into this habbit of checking, **only progress to the next chapter** if you can say 'yes' to all the questions.
