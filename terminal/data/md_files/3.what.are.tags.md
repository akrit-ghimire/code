# What are HTML Tags
HTML is composed of tags. A tag looks like this:
#code-start#
<p>
#code-end#
It is composed of two angled brackets on either side.
#code-start#
*< >*
#code-end#
And a bit in the middle that tells the computer what to do.
#code-start#
<*p*>
#code-end#
It could be a paragraph (<p>), a list (<ul>) or an image (<img>)

# What are HTML Tags
Most tags have a start tag and an end tag:
#code-start#
<start>   <end>
#code-end#
The end tag always includes a slash:
#code-start#
<start>   <*/*end>
#code-end#
These tags are what help the computer decide how to show the content in the middle eg. a <h1> tag will tell the computer to display the bit in the middle of the tags as a title whereas a <p> tag will tell the computer to display the bit in the middle of the tags as a paragraph.
#code-start#
<h1> A Title </h1>
<p> A Paragraph </p>

# The <p> tag
Let's start by practicing a familiar tag, the <p> tag.
Go to this website: 
#a# https://akrit-ghimire.github.io/code/terminal
Once the website has loaded, type this into the main box
#code-start#
<p> hello world </p>
#code-end#
Click run to make sure that this displays a the text correctly.

Now delete that and write the code to display these 3 lines of text on screen.

# The <h1> tag
Coded that correctly? Good Job! Let's move on to another tag, the <h1> tag.
Type this into the main box
#code-start#
<h1> hello world </h1>
#code-end#
Click run to see your code in action.
It should show a really large 'hello world' on screen. This tag displays titles (large text) on screen. It has 6 default settings <h1> (the largest) all the way to <h6> (the smallest).
#newline
#newline
Experiment by changing the <h1> to a <h2> or a <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>. Remember that the <start> tag and </end> tag must match up eg. a <h2> tag has an end </h2> tag not, <h2></h6>
#code-start#
<h*6*> hello...
#code-end#

# The <h1> tag
Now delete that and write the code to display these 3 lines of titles on screen. You may need to 'trial and error' to get the right <h...> tag.

# The <ul> tag
What if we want a list? The following code is how we code bullet points onto a website. Type this into the main box:
#code-start#
<ul>
    <li>The first bullet point</li>
    <li>The second bullet point</li>
</ul>
#code-end#
Click run to see your code in action.

You only need one pair of <ul></ul> tags to tell the computer that the code will store a list, after that you can add as many <li></li> tags as needed for the amount of bullet points you want.
#newline
#newline
If you change the <ul>...</ul> to <ol>...</ol>, you change it from bullet points to a numbered list.

# The <img> tag
Most websites display an image to show information. Type this into the main box:
#code-start#
<img>
#code-end#
If you run this, nothing will happen as we have not told the computer what picture to show. Change this by getting a picture from google. 
#a# https://www.google.com
Find a picture then right click on the mouse and copy its **image address**. 
!./md_media/3_what_are_tags_4.gif
In between the '<img' and '>' include this:
#code-start#
<img *src=""*>
#code-end#
In between the 2 speech marks paste in the image address.
#code-start#
<img src="*https://icatcare.org/app/uploads/2018/07/Thinking-of-getting-a-cat.png*">
#code-end#
When you click run, you will see a picture load on your website. However, it might be too big, so let's adjust the width and height of it. After the src="..." add these. The dimensions will be in pixels (px).
#code-start#
<img src="..." *width="400px" height="200px"*>
#code-end#
When you click run, you will see that the image is smaller (or bigger) than it originally was. This is how you include images on your website!
