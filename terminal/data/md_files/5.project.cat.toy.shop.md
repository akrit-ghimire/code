# The Website Requirements
!./md_media/5_project_cat_toy_shop_2.jpg
The website must display the products:
- A scratching post (£19.99)
- A cat blanket (£5.99)
- A toy mouse (£1.50)
And the website name: Olivia's Feline Fun.

We will now begin working on the website. This will mostly be me showing you what to do and you copying it, you will learn how to use the tags you've learnt in a more professional and complex way.

# Writing the HTML
Go to this website: 
#a# https://akrit-ghimire.github.io/code/terminal
Once the website has loaded, type this into the main box:
#code-start#
<body>
</body>
#code-end#
This new tag essentially is a container for all our website code, it's not too special.

# Writing the HTML
#code-start#
<body>
    *<section>*
        *<h1></h1>*
    *</section>*
</body>
#code-end#
This next bit will be displaying a title at the top of our website. Inside the <h1> tags, add the website name.
#code-start#
<body>
    <section>
        <h1>*Olivia's Feline Fun*</h1>
    </section>
</body>
#code-end#
If you click run, you will see the website title at the top of the screen just as expected!

# Writing the HTML
Next we will add another 'section' of the website where we will display the products:
#code-start#
<body>
    <section>
        <h1>Olivia's Feline Fun</h1>
    </section>
    *<section>*
    *</section>*
</body>
#code-end#
Inside this section we will include a <div> tag (another container) that will store our product information, inside that tag is a <img> tag to show a picture of the product and a <p> tag to tell the user what the product is and how much it costs.
#code-start#
<body>
    <section>
        <h1>Olivia's Feline Fun</h1>
    </section>

        *<div>*

# Writing the HTML
Next we will tell the computer what picture to use. Inside the <p> tags we will put the product information eg what it is and how much it costs.
#code-start#
<body>
    <section>
        <h1>Olivia's Feline Fun</h1>

# Styling the website
Now that the HTML is all written, we can start making the website look nicer. Find the body tag and in between the '<body' and '>' include this:
#code-start#
<body *style=""*>
    <section>...
#code-end#
Now type these in between the 2 speech marks.
#code-start#
<body style="
    *margin: 0;*
    *padding: 0;*
    *box-sizing: border-box;*
    *overflow-x: hidden;*
    *font-family: sans-serif;*
">
    <section>...
#code-end#
When you run this, nothing will appear to have changed, this is because the styles we added were a whole bunch of 'reset styles' to make the website a blank canvas. Click next page to start adding some noticable change to the website.

# Styling the title
Find the <section> that contains our title Olivia's Feline Fun. Just like before, add a style="" in between the '<section' and '>':
#code-start#
<section *style=""*>
    <h1>Olivia's Feline Fun</h1>
</section>
#code-end#
In between the 2 speech marks include these 'styles':
#code-start#
<section style="
    *width: 100%;*
    *background-color: #BFB5D7;*
    *font-size: 70px;*
    *color: white;*
    *text-align: center;*
">
    <h1>Olivia's Feline Fun</h1>

Now if you click run, you will definitely see noticable change!

# Extension
You've now done all the hard-work, the website shows a spectacular title and a nice looking product. However, it doesn't show the other two products that Olivia wanted on the website. Your last task for this project is to include these last two products onto the website.

When complete the website should look like this:

You may have different product images to me but that is fine!
