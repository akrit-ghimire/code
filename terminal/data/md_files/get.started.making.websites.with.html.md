# Websites are made with code!

It may come as a shock (or not), but websites are made with code, lines and lines of giberish that makes you look like a hacker in a sci-fi movie. You may have heard of it before but...

?? What is code?
?x A sci-fi thing that makes no sense
?c A bunch of symbols letters and numbers arranged in a certain way

# What is code?

Code is just a bunch of symbols, letters and numbers arranged in a certain way. That's all it is! The computer reads the code you've written as instructions and it does what it's told - no questions asked. But that can sometimes be annoying because if you give a wrong instruction, the computer won't know any better and still do it even if it's wrong!

# How do computers understand code?

To understand this (take National 5 Computing or) try this quick experiment. In this scenario, you will be the computer and I will be the coder (someone who writes code). Below, I have typed out a bunch of letters and a symbol. Can you understand what I have just told you?

# Can't understand me?

If I rearange what I have typed, can you understand me now?

Did you say hello? No? Anyway, what you have tried out is a very large oversimplification of what actually goes on. When you write code, the computer translates your strange English into a language it understands called Binary. Once translated, it reads your code again, this time it knows what you're saying and will carry out whatever instruction you have told it to do.

But, the computer is very fussy, if you so much as spell a word wrong, it will scream (error) at you because it doesn't understand what you have said. That's why, as a general golden rule, if your code doesn't work check it carefully since 9 times out of 10 a typo is what's actually giving you trouble.

# To be more specific

Code is an umbrella term, it groups all types (languages) of code. When making websites we use a certain type (language) of code called HTML. What is HTML? You'll find that out in the next tutorial!
