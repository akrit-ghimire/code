# What is HTML?

First of all, have you used websites before? Yes? How do you think they were made?
Every website that is on the internet is made by code.
But what is code?

# What is code?

This is code:
#code-start#
<section>
    <p>hi</p>
</section>
#code-end#

This too is code:
#code-start#
console.log('hi')
#code-end#

This is also code:
#code-start#
p:after {
    content: 'hi';
}
#code-end#

# But what is code?
Code is just a bunch of symbols, letters and numbers arranged in a certain way. The computer reads this as instructions and does what you tell it to do.

So lets test this out.

# Quick Experiment
For this experiment, you will be the 'computer' and I will be the 'coder'.
Below is a bunch of letters I have typed up. Can you understand what I have just told you to do?

# Quick Experiment
Now when I rearange these letters in a certain way...

You now understand what I have just told you to do.
This is what happens when you write code. You need to be careful to write it correctly otherwise the computer won't understand what you want it to do.

# Similarities with the real world
Just like in the real world we have many languages to say the same thing, for example,
- hello
- bonjour
- namaste
#newline

So too in the code world do we have many ways to **do** the same thing, for example:
#code-start#
<section>
    <p>hi</p>
</section>

console.log('hi')

p:after {
    content: 'hi';
}
#code-end#
All of these will show 'hi' on screen.

# So what is HTML?

HTML is a coding language (a bunch of symbols, letters and numbers arranged in a certain way). And it is the main language we use to make websites.

So let's start writing some HTML...

# Your first website

Go to this website: 
#a# https://akrit-ghimire.github.io/code/terminal

Once the website has loaded, type these into the main box
#code-start#
<div>
    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>this is another line</p>
    <p>just some more text</p>
</div>
#code-end#

When you are done, click run to see what happens...

# Your first website
When you click run, you will see 3 lines appear on the screen:
!./md_media/1_first_website_3.jpg
Let's change what it says on screen. To do this, change the text in between the <p> and </p> tags. Make the lines say:
- My name is
- My favourite colour is
- My dream last night was

Click the small purple 'x' button in the bottom left corner of the screen and click the 'html' tab to get back to your code.

Change your code to include the text from above, then click run.

# Your first website
You have now successfully changed what it says on the website! This is essentially what website making is. You write some code and change some code and out comes a website

Your next job is to add another line of text on the website saying what you want to do when you leave school.

Hmm... how will you add another line of text? Before clicking the next page to see the answers first try to figure it out yourself.

# The Answer
Just add another <p>text</p> line and you will get another line of text on the website!
#code-start#
<div>
    <p>My name is Akrit</p>
    <p>My favourite colour is purple</p>
    <p>My dream last night was about website club!</p>
    <p>When I leave school I want to go explore the world</p>
</div>
#code-end#
Now go try the 'Poem Activity' to practice what you have learnt.
