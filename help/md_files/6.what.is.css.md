# What is CSS
CSS is just like HTML, it is a coding language. HTML is used to lay out the structure of a website, whereas CSS is used to make the website look nice.

# The power of CSS
CSS can dramatically change how a website looks. It can turn a boring, simple website into a more modern, user-friendly website.

# Getting started with CSS
Go to this website: 
#a# https://akrit-ghimire.github.io/code/terminal
Once the website has loaded, type this into the main box:
#code-start#
<h1>Hello User</h1>
#code-end#
When you click run, as expected, it will look like this:

# Getting started with CSS
Now let's add some CSS to this. To start, add <style></style> tags to your code, above the <h1></h1> tags. 
#code-start#
*<style>*

*</style>*
<h1>Hello User</h1>
#code-end#
Then in between the '<h1' and '>' include a 'class' attribute. You can call it anything in between the speech marks but for this tutorial call it 'myTag'.
#code-start#
<style>
    
</style>
<h1 *class="myTag"*>Hello User</h1>
#code-end#

# Getting started with CSS
Start by referencing the 'class name' i.e. 'myTag' and then two curly brackets as shown here:
#code-start#
<style>
*.*myTag {

}
</style>
<h1 class="myTag">Hello User</h1>
#code-end#
Inside these curly brackets we are going to add all our CSS code.

# Changing the size of the text
We write 'font-size', a colon in between, then a value (how big we want the text to be). Followed by 'px' (short for pixels). Lastly, a semi-colon.
#code-start#
<style>
.myTag {
    *font-size: 100px;*
}
</style>
<h1 class="myTag">Hello User</h1>
#code-end#
When you run the website, you will see that the text quite big. Experiment with the values and see what happens.

# Changing the colour of the text
We write 'color' (american spelling), a colon in between, then a value which tells the computer what colour we want our text to be. Followed by a semi-colon.
#code-start#
<style>
.myTag {
    *color: rgb(245, 33, 234);*
}
</style>
<h1 class="myTag">Hello User</h1>

# Changing the background colour of the text
We write 'background-color' (american spelling), a colon in between, then a value which tells the computer what background colour our text will have. Followed by a semi-colon.

.myTag {
    *background-color: rgb(245, 33, 234);*

# A quick intro to CSS
This was a quick intro into what CSS is. Although some of the code you saw was quite similar to what you've done before, this is a slightly more professional way of laying it out and will allow you to easily make your future websites look more nicer.
